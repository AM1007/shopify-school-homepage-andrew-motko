            <p>Nike’s delivery options? Standard, express, or “Just Ship It.” Your shoes might arrive faster than your motivation to use them. Unless you're ordering from the future—then they'll time-travel straight to your regret pile next to the dumbbells.</p>

            <p>When you shop Nike online, either in the Nike App or on Nike.com, you can return items that are unworn and unwashed and still have their product tags attached within 30 days of purchase (some exceptions apply). That includes custom Nike By You sneakers.</p>

            <p>Where’s your Nike order? Probably jogging to your house—takes breaks every mile for hydration and self-reflection. Or it's chilling in a warehouse, dreaming of freedom. Don’t worry, it’ll show up right after you finally give up and go barefoot to brunch.</p>

            <p>How do you find the right size and fit? Easy—consult Nike’s size chart, sacrifice a sock to the sneaker gods, and pray. Or just try three sizes, return two, and keep the one that insults your toes the least. Precision, baby. Science-ish.</p>
